This results in situations where \nStock Exchanges are burdened with multiple settlements on the working day \nimmediately following the day(s) of closure. Thus with the view to enable \nsmooth Settlement process and enable Exchanges meet their obligations the \nAdvisory Committee on Derivatives and Market Risk Management (RMG) in \nconsultation with the Stock Exchanges and the Depositories has provided the \nfollowing guidelines: \ni. \nThe Stock Exchanges shall clear and settle the trades on a sequential basis \ni.e., the pay-in and the pay-out of the first settlement shall be completed \nbefore the commencement of the pay-in and pay-out of the subsequent \nsettlement(s). \nii. \nThe cash/Securities pay out from the first settlement shall be made \navailable to the member for meeting his pay-in obligations for the \nsubsequent settlement/s.  \niii. \nFurther, in-order to meet his pay-in obligations for the subsequent    \nsettlement, the member may need to move securities from one depository \nto another. The Depositories shall, therefore, facilitate the inter-depository \ntransfers within one hour and before pay-in for the subsequent settlement \nbegins.  \niv. \nThe Stock Exchanges/Depositories shall follow a strict time schedule to \nensure that the settlements are completed on the same day.  \nv. \nThe Clearing Corporation/Clearing House of the Stock Exchanges shall \nexecute Auto DO facility for all the settlements together, so as to make the \nfunds and the securities available with the member on the same day for all \nthe settlements, thereby enabling the availability of the funds/securities at \nthe client level by the end of the same day. \n6.2  \nSettlement in case of Unscheduled Holidays25 \nIf the settlement holiday is unscheduled (on account of strike etc.) the clubbing of \nsettlement at the last minute may not be possible and the provision of SEBI letter \n(ref.

The failure of one member has cascading effects on others as \nwell. Thus objective behind the establishment of clearing corporation/settlement \nguarantee fund is to ensure that there is no delay in settlement due to failure of \nany member to honour his commitment to the exchange on time. \n7.2 \nThe Objective of the Fund \nThe objective of the SGF is to guarantee settlement of all transactions of the members \nof the exchange inter-se through the stock exchange. In the event of a member failing to \nhonour his settlement commitments, the SGF will undertake to fulfill the commitment of \nthat member and will complete the settlement without affecting the normal settlement \nprocess. In the case of clearing corporation, all the trades are settled through the clearing \ncorporation and clearing corporation becomes the counter party for all the trades. The \nclearing corporation also guarantees settlement of all trades. \n7.3 Corpus of the fund \nThe corpus of the fund should be adequate to meet out all the contingencies \narising on account of failure of any member/members. The risk/liability to the \nfund depends on various factors such as trade volume, delivery percentage, \nmaximum settlement liability of  the members, the history of defaults at the \nexchange, capital adequacy of the members, and the degree of surveillance and \nsafety measures i.e. imposition of mark to market margins, trade restrictions etc., \nimplemented by the exchange. A fixed formula, therefore, cannot be prescribed \nto estimate the risk/liability of the fund.  However, in order to assess the fair \nquantum of the corpus of SGF, an assessment on the following factors prevailing \nat the particular Stock Exchange may be necessary. \nRisk Management system in force at the Exchange  \ni. \nThe extent of implementation of various margins systems and the \n \nlevel of threshold limits. \nii. \nThe percentage of margins (paid by the members) to their pay-in \n \nliabilities  \niii. \nControl on off-market transactions \n                                                 \n26 Circular No. SMD/POLICY/SGF/CIR-13/97 dated June 09, 1997 \n  Circular No. SEBI/SMD/SE/21 /2003/05/06 dated June 5, 2003 \n  Circular No. SMDRP/POLICY /CIR -16/2001 dated March 9, 2001 \n\n\n \n¼ããÀ¦ããè¾ã   ¹ãÆãä¦ã¼ãîãä¦ã   ‚ããõÀ   ãäÌããä¶ã½ã¾ã   ºããñ¡Ã \nSecurities and Exchange Board of India \n \nPage 18 of 45 \n \niv. \nCapital adequacy of members (Base minimum capital and the \n \nadditional  \ncapital deposited with the Exchange) \nv. \nThe effectiveness of the surveillance system at the Exchange. \nvi. \nMinimum expenses limit fixed by the Exchange. \n2.  The track record of defaults of members  (Gross amount of default and the net \namount) in the last 10 years. \n3.  The track record of disciplinary action for financial defaults taken by the \nExchange in the last 10 years \n4.  The settlement liability of the top 10 members ( settlement liability wise ) in \nthe highest settlement in the last 1 year.. \n5.  Implementation of suggestions made in the SEBI Inspection Reports by the \nStock Exchange. \n6.  The projected volume of business and  deliveries at the Exchange for the next \nthree years. \nA realistic assessment on the adequacy of the above factors relating to the \nparticular Stock Exchange need to be made. In case of any deficiency / non-\nsatisfactory level of performance of the Exchange, the expected level of \nrisk/liability to the SGF will increase and accordingly it will require a higher \nlevel of corpus. \nFurther in order to assess the minimum level of corpus of SGF,  the following \nnorms may be considered. \na. \nIt may be assumed that in a worst case, the top ten members (highest \nsettlement in last one year settlement liability-wise) of the exchange \nwould default simultaneously in a settlement. \nb. \nIt may be assumed that there will be a maximum loss of 20% in the value \non the net basis in the process of reversing the trade or squaring off the \nposition. \nc. \nThe loss may be assumed to be recovered from the following sources : \n Margins deposited with the Exchange. \n The short fall will be first met from Income of the SGF (interest on \ndeposits and recurring sources such as the turnover based \ncontributions from members etc). \n The, balance, shortfall, if any might be recovered from the corpus of \nSGF.  \nIn the normal course, the total income from the interest earned on cash portions \nof the corpus of SGF and other recurring contributions to SGF by member should \nbe adequate to take care of the unexpected liability as per (b) above, For example \n\n\n \n¼ããÀ¦ããè¾ã   ¹ãÆãä¦ã¼ãîãä¦ã   ‚ããõÀ   ãäÌããä¶ã½ã¾ã   ºããñ¡Ã \nSecurities and Exchange Board of India \n \nPage 19 of 45 \n \nif the total loss on settlement liabilities of the top ten brokers is Rs 2 Crs in a \nparticular settlement, income generation from the fund (including recurring \nincome) should not be less than Rs 2 Crs p.a. \n7.4 \nContribution to the Fund \nThe basic objective of the fund is to provide safety to the members against the \nrisk of failure of any other member/s in the settlement, therefore the contribution \nto the corpus of SGF should be made by the members. The exchange may \ncontribute towards the corpus of the fund out of the free reserves and by way of \nappropriation of the members fund lying with it. The base minimum capital \ncontributed by the members may be used for building up the corpus of the SGF. \nFor better liquidity, it should be ensured that the securities accepted towards \ncontribution to the base minimum capital consist of only NIFTY (NSE 50 Index) \nScrips which are freely usable by SGF in meeting out any risk / liability. The \nmembers may also be required to contribute to the fund by way of bank \nguarantee revocable at the instance of SGF against the default by any member.   \nIn order to generate regular income to the fund, the members should pay \nturnover based contribution to this fund. This contribution made by the \nmembers should not be recovered from investors. \n7.5  \nManagement of the fund: \nThe management of the SGF should be in the hands of an independent \ncommittee represented by members and outsiders. The constitution of the \ncommittee should be approved by SEBI. \n7.6  \nAccess to the fund: \nIn the event of a failure of member/s to honour their settlement commitment, the \nSGF will fulfill the commitment only after declaring the member/s as defaulter/s \nand such member/s would not be eligible to continue to trade and default \nproceedings as per the bye-laws of the exchange would have to be initiated \nagainst him. \n7.7 \nRecoupment of the corpus \nIt should be ensured that the corpus of the SGF will not fall below the initial \ncorpus or 75% of the closing value of the fund as on date immediately preceding \nMarch 31, which ever is higher and it will increase in proportion of increase in \nmembership / turnover. \n7.8 \nUtilisation of Settlement Guarantee Fund \nIn cases where amount shortages in a settlement for a trading member are in \nexcess of the base minimum capital (BMC) prescribed, the trading facility of the \n\n\n \n¼ããÀ¦ããè¾ã   ¹ãÆãä¦ã¼ãîãä¦ã   ‚ããõÀ   ãäÌããä¶ã½ã¾ã   ºããñ¡Ã \nSecurities and Exchange Board of India \n \nPage 20 of 45 \n \nmember shall be withdrawn and the securities pay-out due to the member shall \nbe withheld. The trading facility of the member shall be withdrawn and the \nsecurities pay-out due to the member shall be withheld, even in cases where the \namount of shortages exceed 20% of the BMC and is less than the BMC on six \noccasions within a period of three months. \nOn complete recovery of the shortages, the member shall be permitted to trade \nwith a reduced gross exposure as follows: \n \nCumulative Funds Shortage \nExposure limit allowed  \n(%of \ncurrent \nexposure \nlimit) \n20% of BMC –  50% of BMC \n80% \n50% of BMC – 100% of BMC \n60% \nThis reduced gross exposure level shall be maintained for the member for ten \nrolling settlements. If the cumulative funds shortages for the next ten rolling \nsettlements (previously four rolling settlements), is less than 20% of BMC, the \nexposure limits shall be restored.  However, if a member provides a deposit \nequivalent to his cumulative fund shortages as the 'funds shortage collateral' in \nhis clearing account the exposure limit may be restored immediately upon \nmeeting the shortage. Such deposit shall be kept with the Exchange for a period \nof ten rolling settlements and shall be released only if no further funds shortages \nare reported for the member in next ten rolling settlements. The member shall \nnot be given any exposure benefit or any interest payment on the amount so \ndeposited as 'funds shortage collateral'. Members may deposit the ‘funds \nshortage collateral' by way of cash, fixed deposit receipts or bank guarantee. \nThe outstanding amount would carry a penal interest of not less than 0.07% \n(previously 0.09%) per day. \n \nThe amounts lying in the aforesaid funds would not be available for settling any \nloss suffered in connection with the margin trading facility. However, the \naforesaid funds will continue to be available for all transactions done on the \nexchange, whether normal or through margin trading facility.27 \n \n \n                                                 \n27 Circular No. SEBI/MRD/SE/SU/Cir-15/04 dated March 19, 2004 \n\n\n \n¼ããÀ¦ããè¾ã   ¹ãÆãä¦ã¼ãîãä¦ã   ‚ããõÀ   ãäÌããä¶ã½ã¾ã   ºããñ¡Ã \nSecurities and Exchange Board of India \n \nPage 21 of 45 \n \nSECTION -8: TRANSFER OF FUNDS AND SECURITIES \n8.1 \nTransfer of Funds and Securities from member to client28 \nThe member shall transfer Funds and Securities from their respective pool \naccount to the respective beneficiary account of their client within 1 working day \nafter the pay-out day.  \nThe Securities lying in the pool account beyond the above period would not be \neligible for delivery in the subsequent settlement(s) and would also be not \neligible for pledging or stock lending purpose, until the same is credited to the \nbeneficiary accounts. \nThe Securities lying in the pool account beyond the stipulated 1 day shall attract \na penalty at the rate of 6 basis point per week on the value of securities.

After passing through ‘B’ \nand ‘C’ the shares were lodged by ‘D’ to the company for transfer. After \nreceiving the shares duly transferred from the company in his name ‘D’ sold the \nshares in the market. These shares after passing through ‘X’ and ‘Y’ are finally \nsent by ‘Z’ to the company for transfer in his/her name. After receiving the \nshares from the company duly transferred in his name, ‘Z’ has received a letter \nfrom the company stating that the shares transferred in the name of ‘D’ were \nbased on fraudulent documents.  \n ‘Z’ will report the objection along with  the company objection against ‘D’. \n ‘D’ will rectify/replace the shares within 21 days as per the BDC procedures. \n ‘D’ may in turn lodge the bad delivery for rectification through the BDC \nagainst ‘A’. \nThe validity period of reporting such cases will be 36 months from the date of \nlatest transfer by the company (in the above example 36 months from the date \nthe shares were transferred in the name of ‘Z’).  \nThe company will also furnish copies of both sides of transfer deed based on \nwhich shares were transferred in favor of ‘Z’ and ‘D’ along with the objection \nmemo.   \n \n101 \nIn case of joint holding, and in event of death of any of the holders, transfer can \ntake place on the basis of death certificate accompanying the transfer deed only \nfor a period of two years from the date of the death or ensuing book closure, \nwhichever is later. \nThe Introducing member of a recognised stock exhange may certify/attest copy \nof the death certificate and also issue an identity certificate in case where the \nname of the deceased on the share certificate is not identical with the name on the \ndeath certificate - GOOD \n102 \nWhile rectifying objections due to signature differences, a fresh signature by the \ntransferor (if the same transfer deed is re-submitted) alongwith attestation is \nmandatory.  Fresh transfer deed is mandatory if objection is rectified after book \nclosure date. \n103 \nIn case Rights/Bonus shares tendered as corporate benefits are reported as bad \ndelivery, if it is odd lot, the value of shares based on the rate prevalent on the day \n\n\n \n¼ããÀ¦ããè¾ã   ¹ãÆãä¦ã¼ãîãä¦ã   ‚ããõÀ   ãäÌããä¶ã½ã¾ã   ºããñ¡Ã \nSecurities and Exchange Board of India \n \nPage 42 of 45 \n \nof reporting bad delivery will be paid. \n104 \nRectification/replacement of transfer deed under objection should be in market lot \nonly (even if transfer deed under objection is submitted in non-market lot). \n105 \nIf Jumbo transfer deed is submitted as company objection, original transfer deeds \nneed not be returned by the receiving member.  \n106 \nWhen documents are returned under signature difference, the transfer deed can be \nattested by the introducing member.  If the introducing member is a corporate, the \nDirector or authorised signatory can attest the transfer deed, under his company's \nstamp, with SEBI Registration Number. \n107 \nFor reporting as company objections, the transferee portion of the transfer deed \nshould be duly filled in. \n108 \nFor reporting as company objection, the following documents are required: \nA. \nIf they are returned as objection from the company due to the above reason: \n. \ncompany objection memo stating that the shares are fake/ forged \n. \ncopies of both sides of the transfer deeds \n. \ncopies of both sides of the share certificates   \nB \nOtherwise one of the following documents are required: \n. \npublic notice given by the company/registrar \n. \nnotification from any stock exchange \n. \nletter of intimation from the company to stock exchange.   \n109 \nFor reporting missing/lost/stolen shares as objection the following documents \nare required : \nA.
