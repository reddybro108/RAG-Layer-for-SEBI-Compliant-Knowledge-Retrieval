Any transaction of Front Running by any employee directly or \nindirectly is strictly prohibited. For this purpose, “Front Running” \nmeans any transaction of purchase and/or sale of a security carried \nby any employee whether for self or for any other person, knowing \nfully well that the AMC also intends to purchase and/or sell the \nsame security for its Mutual Fund operations. To ascertain that the \nemployee had no prior knowledge of the Mutual Fund's intended \ntransactions, the Compliance Officer may take a declaration in this \nregard from the employee.

These \nduration buckets may be changed to reflect the market value more \nclosely by any agency suggested by AMFI giving benchmark yield/ \nmatrix of spreads over benchmark yield.  \n                                                 \n191 SEBI Circular No. MFD/CIR/14/442/2002 dated February 20, 2002. \n \n, ,  \n192 SEBI Circular No.Cir/IMD/DF/6/2012 dated February 28, 2012 \n193 SEBI/IMD/CIR No.16/ 193388/2010 dated February 02, 2010 \n\n\n 86                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds\n \nb. The benchmark as calculated above will be set at least weekly, and \nin the event of any significant movement in prices of Government \nSecurities on account of any event impacting interest rated on any \nday such as a change in the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)  policies, \nthe benchmark will be reset to reflect any change in the market \nconditions.  \n9.3.2 Building a Matrix of Spreads for Marking-up the Benchmark Yield194  \n9.3.2.1 Mark up for credit risk over the risk free benchmark YTM as \ncalculated in 9.3.1 above, will be determined using the trades of \ncorporate debentures/bonds of different ratings. All trades on \nappropriate stock exchange during the fortnight prior to the \nbenchmark date will be used in building the corporate YTM and \nspread matrices. Initially these matrices will be built only for \ncorporate securities of investment grade. The matrices are \ndynamic and the spreads will be computed every week. The matrix \nwill be built for all duration buckets for which the benchmark GOI \nmatrix is built to effectively link the corporate matrix with the GOI \nsecurities matrix. Accordingly:  \na. All traded paper (with minimum traded value of `1 crore) will be \nclassified by their ratings and grouped into 7 duration buckets; for \nrated securities, the most conservative publicly available rating will \nbe used;  \nb. For each rating category, average volume weighted yield will be \nobtained both from trades on the appropriate stock exchange and \nfrom the primary market issuances  \nc. Where there are no secondary trades on the appropriate stock \nexchange in a particular rating category and no primary market \n                                                 \n194 SEBI Circular No. MFD/CIR/8/92/2000 dated September 18, 2000. \n \n\n\n 87                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds\nissuances during the fortnight under consideration, then trades on \nappropriate stock exchange during the 30 day period prior to the \nbenchmark date will be considered for computing the average YTM \nfor such rating category;  \nd. If the matrix cannot be populated using any or all of the above \nsteps, then credit spreads from trades on appropriate stock \nexchange of the relevant rating category over the AAA trades will be \nused to populate the matrix;  \ne. In each rating category, all outliers will be removed for \nsmoothening the YTM matrix;  \nf. Spreads will be obtained by deducting the YTM in each duration \ncategory from the respective YTM of the GOI securities;  \ng. In the event of lack of trades in the secondary market and the \nprimary market the gaps in the matrix would be filled by \nextrapolation. If the spreads cannot be extrapolated for the reason \nof practicality, the gaps in the matrix will be filled by carrying the \nspreads from the last matrix. \nh. Accordingly, all Mutual Funds shall provide transaction details of \nvarious types of debt securities like NCDs, Mibor linked floaters \nand CPs on daily basis in the prescribed format enclosed at \nAnnexure 3 to the agency recommended by AMFI. Submission of \ndata would help in daily matrix generation, would improve \nuniformity and accuracy of valuation in the Mutual Funds \nindustry195.  \n9.3.3 Mark-up/Mark-down Yield \n \n9.3.3.1 The Yields calculated would be marked-up/marked-down to \naccount for the illiquidity risk, promoter background, finance \ncompany risk and the issuer class risk.

For e.g. if the due date for interest is 30.06.2000, it \nwill be classified as NPA from 01.10.2000.  \n9.7.3 Treatment of income accrued on the NPA and further accruals \n \n9.7.3.1 After the expiry of the 1st quarter from the date the income has \nfallen due, there will be no further interest accrual on the asset \ni.e. if the due date for interest falls on 30.06.2000 and if the \ninterest is not received, accrual will continue till 30.09.2000 after \nwhich there will be no further accrual of income.

Further, no accrual will take \nplace from 01.10.2000 onwards. Full provision will be made for \ninterest accrued and outstanding as on 30.06.2000.  \n9.7.4 Provision for NPAs – Debt Securities \n \n9.7.4.1 Both secured and unsecured investments, once they are \nrecognized   as NPAs, call for provisioning in the same manner \nand where these are related to close ended schemes, the phasing \nwould be such that to ensure full provisioning prior to the closure \nof the scheme or the scheduled phasing which ever is earlier.  \n \n9.7.4.2 The value of the asset shall be provided in the following manner or \nearlier at the discretion of the Mutual Fund. Mutual Funds will \nnot have discretion to extend the period of provisioning. The \nprovisioning against the principal amount or installments shall be \nmade at the following rates irrespective of whether the principal is \ndue for repayment or not. \n \na. 10 percent of the book value of the asset shall be provided for after \n6 months past due date of interest i.e. 3 months form the date of \nclassification of the asset as NPA.  \nb. 20 percent of the book value of the asset should be provided for \nafter 9 months past due date of interest i.e. 6 months from the \ndate of classification of the asset as NPA.  \n\n\n 93                                                                     Master Circular for Mutual Funds\nc. Another 20 percent of the book value of the assets shall be \nprovided for after 12 months past due date of interest i.e. 9 months \nfrom the date of classification of the asset as NPA.  \nd. Another 25 percent of the book value of the assets shall be \nprovided for after 15 months past due date of interest i.e. 12 \nmonths from the date of classification of the asset as NPA.  \ne. The balance 25 percent of the book value of the asset shall be \nprovided for after 18 months past due date of the interest i.e. 15 \nmonths from the date of classification of the assets as NPA.  \n \n9.7.4.3 Book value for the purpose of provisioning for NPAs shall be taken \nas a value determined as per the prescribed valuation method.  \n9.7.4.4 This can be explained by an illustration:  \na. Let us consider that interest income is due on a half yearly basis \nand the due date falls on 30.06.2000 and the interest is not \nreceived till 1st quarter after due date i.e. 30.09.2000.
